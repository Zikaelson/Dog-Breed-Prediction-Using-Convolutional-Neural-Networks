# Dog-Breed-Prediction-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

This project aims to build, train, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras and TensorFlow to identify the breed of a dog from an image. This is a supervised learning problem and specifically a multiclass classification problem.

## Overview
The objective is to create a robust CNN model that can classify images of dogs into their respective breeds. The dataset contains images of dogs from various breeds along with their corresponding labels, and the project demonstrates the use of different types of layers in a CNN to achieve accurate classification.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the "Dog Breed Identification" dataset from Kaggle. It consists of images of dogs categorized by their breeds. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture includes:

Conv2D Layers: For feature detection.
MaxPooling2D Layers: For downsampling the input.
Flatten Layer: To convert multi-dimensional input into a 1D output.
Dense Layers: For classification, with ReLU activation for non-linearity and softmax activation in the output layer.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

## Usage
Upload the Kaggle API key to Google Colab.
Set up the Kaggle API.
Download the dataset.
Train and evaluate the model.

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated on the test set, providing an accuracy score. Visualizations of the training history help understand the model's learning process.
